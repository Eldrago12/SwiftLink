# SwiftLink

SwiftLink is a serverless URL shortener service built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Secrets Manager, Route53, AWS Certificate Manager, and JWT Authentication using Firebase. The service provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting shortened URLs. Additionally, an iOS app built with Swift and SwiftUI interacts with the API to manage URLs.

## iOS App

The iOS app is developed using Swift and SwiftUI. It interacts with the serverless API to manage shortened URLs.

## Features

  - **Create Shortened URLs:** Use the `/createurl` API ednpoint along with baseurl to create new shortened URLs.
  - **Retrieve URLs:** Display the list of URLs created by the user by triggering the `/geturl` API endpoint in an interactive SwiftUI View with Glass Effect.
  - **Delete URLs:** Delete specific URLs using their ID that stored in DynamoDB.
  - **View:** Implemented Dark and light mode toggle and smooth animantion between pages and Glass Effect in `DeletedView` and `PreviouslyCreatedView` page view.


## Instructions for iOS App

1. **Move to Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SwiftLink
   ```

2. **Open the project in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open SwiftLink.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Open the `ContentView.Swift` file in `SwiftLink` directory to get the UI Structure directly and navigate to other pages. 

4. **Build and Run the App:**
